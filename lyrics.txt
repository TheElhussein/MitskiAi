I'm beautiful, I know cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me
Or at least take my picture
Kuzurete yuku maeni
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall
How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me
You're home, you're home
You're home to me
So leave me, leave me
Leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down
I cannot bear you a son, but I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am alone
I have, I have, I watch a dream
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I'm looking down from
I cannot bear you a son, I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown
So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear
I am hungry
I have been hungry
I was born hungry
What do I need?
I am something
I have been something
I was born something
What could I be?
There is a light that I can see
But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see
That only appears in the dark of sleep
I am waiting
I have been waiting
I was born waiting
I was born waiting
For that something
Just to want something
I was born something
I was born
There is a light, I feel it in me
But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me
There is a dream and it sleeps in me
To awake in the night, crying, "Set me free"
And I awake every night, crying, "Set me free"
One, two
Honey, what'd you take?
Think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down
But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me how you choose
Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head
Makes me forgive you
But how long, how long can we play this way
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules
Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin
It cries a soft weep like mine
I'll sell, I'll sell my heart to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price?
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you?
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I'm all used up, pretty boy, over and over again
My nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy, what do they tell you?
'Cause I've looked down at them not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickity-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones
Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?
I know my room is a mess, over and over again
I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed and do what you came here to do
But first open up a window for me
And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back
And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone
Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?
And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it?
Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it love
Mmm, mhm, mhm
Mmm, mhm, mhm
Treasure hunter you are dead, the light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end, your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your working mind, don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide with the monsters on your shoulder
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Oh hunter, if you didn't want the beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it in your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human, don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you, though the struggle will be daily
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, uh
Treasure hunter you are dead, the light of the world is fading
Real men don't need other people, and
Real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public
Oh, I think I'm a real man
Little boys cry and look around for comfort
And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say "I can take that!"
Oh, you are my little boy
Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down and tell me
"Well done, girl, you're looking good"
Real men keep cool in the face of a fire
Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat
'Cause they're above that, damn it
Oh, I'm gonna be a real man
Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down
And give me your love for being so good
But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely
For a little while
So little boy, say you want me
'Cause, well, I can't take it
Go ahead
Do it, do it
There's nobody better than you
It took me a while 'til I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?
It just took me a while 'til I knew
Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You just grew a little smarter, too
So, I don't blame you
If you want to bury me in your memory
I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends
You can tell them what you saw in me
And not how I turned out to be
There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart
Now here I lay as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you
And I don't blame you
If you want to bury me in your memory
I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends
You can tell them what you saw in me
And not the way I am
And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be?
I'm just about to beg you, please
And then, when you tell your friends
You can tell them what you saw in me
And not the way I used to be
'Cause there is nobody better than you
Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept
I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night, I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake
I would follow the aching inside
I would find
It's for you won't be mine
I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn
What is that quiet of snow in the night?
The dark rings with white noise as you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes
Screaming a choir of mute
As they brace for the ground
Well, that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here, shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me
I tried my hardest, for how do you learn
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you'd offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn
Silly me, waiting
I love everybody because I love you
When you stood up, walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
I looked over it and I ached
I love everybody because I love you
I don't need the city, and I don't need proof
All I need, darlin', is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft, and I ache
Look at you, strawberry blond
Reach out the car window tryin' to hold the wind
You tell me you love her, I give you a grin
Oh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape
So I follow the white lines, follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road as I ache
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rollin' on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rollin' on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rollin' on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need
I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch
I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms
I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving
More
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting
More, more, more
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's much too much
Too frail for me to touch
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But Humpty Dumpty it's much too much
Too frail for me to touch
Humpty Dumpty
It's much too much
I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over and I love you darlin'
And I am done, dear
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream how I love you
I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over and I love you darlin'
And I am done, dear
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream how I love you
I want you
I want you
I can still smell the fire
Even though it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes
So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow
I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh babe
Don't say sorry
Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow
Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for, you
Just play your violin
And we will manage somehow
There's a lie that I told to you
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew
And in the morning, I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew
You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away
There's a lie that I told to you
I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach
I didn't mind, I adored him so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago
Now the tree, it has grown
And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
There's a lie that I told to you
Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too
Mom, would you wash my back?
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue
Mom, am I still young?
Can I dream for a few months more?
It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I want to escape
Texas is a landlocked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home
That I've wanted to make
It's somehow in the city
You make it there
And you make it anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere
And it's not what I want
And I wanna be still with you
Do, do-do-do, do
You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearts warm
See the tree shadows lie in black the pools in the lawns
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
There's a party and we're all going
And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking
And no one's going back
'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full and
Nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight
The boys are gonna go for
More, more, more
And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough
But he wants a finale and I came prepared
And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring
And I've tried putting out
But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for
More, more, more
And change change change is gonna come, but
When, when, when?
And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
The black hole
Of the
Window
Where you sleep
The night breeze
Carries
Something sweet
A peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that
Lately I've been crying like a
Tall child
So please hurry leave me
I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this
Ledge I'm on
Baby
Tell me "don't"
So I can
Crawl back in
And I was so young
When I behaved
Twenty five
Yet now I find
I've grown into
A tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky
Please hurry leave me
I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this
Ledge I'm on
Baby
Tell me "don't"
So I can
Crawl back in
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this
Ledge I'm on
Baby
Tell me "don't"
So I can
Crawl back in
I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at three AM
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
On sunny days I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
I don't smoke
Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it
Tasted true
And I don't smoke
Except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good
So if you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart
I'm what's left of when we
Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just
Waiting for when
You come down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good
If you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart
Just don't leave me alone
Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
Credit for
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart
It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said I'd go
He only loves me when
There's a means he means to end
Oh, I miss when we first met
He didn't know me yet
So take me out, baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out baby
Take me out, baby
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
I will retire to the Salton Sea
At the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money
I'm tired of your money
And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark, it moves
With every breath of the breeze
I will take good care of you
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good
If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night
And dry it off with care
I will see your body bare
And still I will live here
So stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave
And all the quiet nights you bear
Seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there
For I will hold them for you
Cause' all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is
Always you
It's always you
And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you though there's an end
Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave
And while you sleep
I'll be scared
So by the time you wake
I'll be brave
I'll be brave
I'll be brave
At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night
The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I
Say your name
In hopes you'll hear it in the stars
And carry me out
Carry me out
I drive when it rains
At night when it rains I drive
And the headlight spirits
They lead me down the styx
So black it shines
And carry me out
Carry me out
At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night
All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live
You wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the liberty bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye
Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea and he told me it'll all be okay
Well I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt Happy come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy
Oh if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well I sighed and mumbled to myself again, I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself
If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
In the rearview mirror, I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us, our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it
So come inside and be with me, alone with me
Alone, with me alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name
Atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
Come inside and be with me, alone with me
Alone, with me alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name
Atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
If I could see you
Once more to see you
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds
Don't wait for me, I can't come
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl
You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby
I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I'll pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side
Will you let me, baby, lose
On losing dogs
I know they're losing and I'll pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?
Holding hands under a table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm stayin' on later just in case
You come up and ask to leave with me
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?
You only love me when we're all alone
Down empty streets sniffing glue, me and you
Blank open eyes watch the moon flower bloom
It's been a long, hard 20 year summer vacation
Both these 20 years tryna fill the void
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Went to your room thinking maybe you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these 20 years on a vacation
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you want it
Yeah, you know that you want it
You know that you-
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad
Today I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all
So today I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things
My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people
Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much, too?
Did its people want too much?
And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright
And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody
I've been big and small
And big and small
And big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me
And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright
I steal a few breaths
From the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen
Will be gone
With my eyes with my body with me
But me and my husband
We're doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
And I am the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved
Me and my husband
We're doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're doing better
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And you've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down every hand
That has beckoned me to come
'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come
Though I'm a geyser
Feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call
Hear it call to me
Constantly
And hear the harmony
Only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real
It's not real enough
But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you
I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do
So why didn't you stop me?
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?
I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you look how I remember?
Look how I remember
Look how I remember paint it over
We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if
You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little
Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee, talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about
Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch
It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around every night
Just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch
There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill
But it's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around every night
Just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow
I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something
Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say, "Hello"
And I lose
'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me
In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for-
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?
I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying
And make some extra love?
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show
'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me
I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it Heaven?
'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me
I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like Heaven
Come into the water
Do you wanna be my baby?
Are you waiting to touch me?
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water
Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me
I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me
I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you"
I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again
A lake with no fish
Is the heart of a horse
Named Cold Air
Who, when young
Would run like a storm
They would say, ooh
I thought I'd traveled a long way
But I had circled
The same old sin
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby will you kiss me already and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart?
Baby, bang it up inside
Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am
Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out
Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight?
Who will I become tonight?
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes glimmering by a fire
Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains, clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me
I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things too
But I'm working for the knife
I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys
I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife
I used to think I'd be done by twenty
Now at twenty-nine, the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at thirty, I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife
I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right, but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife
Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye
It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you
Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight
Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker
Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
Everyone, all of them
Everyone said, "Don't go that way"
So, of course, to that I said
"I think I'll go that way"
And I left the door open to the dark
I said, "Come in, come in, whatever you are"
But it didn't want me yet
Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said, "Take it all, whatever you want"
I didn't know that I was numb
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take
Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again
Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since one
And now it's four o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing
Are the things all come and gone
And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well, I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones
And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you?
Would that be okay?
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watchin'
I'll be the only heartbreakеr
I'll be the only heartbrеaker
And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker
If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl
I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me
Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up?
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to
Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
There's nothin' left for you
Nothin' in this room
Try and go outside
Nothin' waits for you
You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you
Give her all the love you saved for it
You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life
And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passin' on
Long after you
But you're the only one
She's countin' on
There's nothin' left for you
Well, I went through my list of friends
And found I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling, strange serenity
When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart
The lengths you went to hold me
To get to have me
'Cause, I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relive all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me
I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth, where I'd be stuck a while
When I saw the girl looked just like me
I thought, "Must be lonely loving someone"
Tryna to find their way out of a maze
Oh, I know
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relive all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to
That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
There's a bug like an angel stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older, I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes a drink feels like family
Family
Hey, what's the matter? Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep?
Well, when ya break them, they break you right back
Amateur mistake
You can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
When I'm bent over, wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember the wrath of the devil
Was also given him by God
Mosquitoes can enjoy me, I can't go inside
I'm suckin' up as much of the full moon, so bright
Fireflies zoomin' through the yard like highway cars
Someone out here burnin' something, kids feelin' alive
Freight train stampedin' through my backyard
It'll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced
I have a hope and though she's blind with no name
She shits where she's supposed to, feeds herself while I'm away
Sometimes I think it would be easier without her
But I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleepin' face
Freight train horn howlin' out mad and wild
Headin' somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced
I don't like my mind, I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake
A whole cake, all for me
And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room with the things that I've done
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take my job from me
There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such a walk and I found that I'd said
I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it, I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul?
Then, of course, nothing replied
Nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watching me
So, I stopped and let it watch till I found that it said
Now I'm taken, the night has me
You won't hear me singing, you're a cage without me
Your pain is eased, but you'll never be free
For now, I'm taken, the night has me
There's a deal that I made
When memories snow
And cover up the driveway
I shovel all those memories
Clear the path to drive to the store
And when memories melt
I hear them in the drainpipe
Dripping through the downspout
As I lie awake in the dark
And if I break
Could I go on break?
Be back in my room
Writing speeches in my head
Listening to the thousand hands that clap for me in the dark
Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shining down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
Remember when we met?
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it
That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
It's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light
Burning, so you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on?
You know I'd always been alone
Till you taught me
To live for somebody
That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
'Cause it's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light
Burning, so you can keep looking up
I'm yours no matter
That love's gone
We just see it shining
We've traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light
Burning, so you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on?
You're an angel, I'm a dog
Or you're a dog and I'm your man
You believe me like a God
I destroy you like I am
I'm sorry I'm the one you love
No one will ever love me like you again
So, when you leave me, I should die
I deserve it, don't I?
I can feel it getting near
Like flashlights coming down the way
One day you'll figure me out
I'll meet judgment by the hounds
People always gave me love
Others were never to blame after all
You believe me like a God
I betray you like a man
Brushing my hair naked
Spritz my face with toner
Splash water on my neck
Laughing in the mirror
Cool water in a glass
Drink it down, how
I love me after you
King of all the land
Stride through the house naked
Don't even care that the
Curtains are open
Let the darkness see me
Streets are mine, the night is mine
All my own, how
I love me after you
King of all the land
I'm king of all the land
