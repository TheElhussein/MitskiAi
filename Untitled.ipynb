the beautiful so badly\\nPerhaps you would\\'ve found it in your spirit singing softly\\nBut hunter, you were human, don\\'t forget it and go safely\\nAnd I, I\\'ll live without you, though the struggle will be daily\\nPearl diver\\nDive, dive deeper\\nPearl diver\\nDive, dive down\\nPearl diver\\nDive, dive deeper\\nPearl diver\\nDive, dive down\\nOoh-ooh\\nOoh-ooh\\nOh-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\\nOoh-ooh, uh\\nTreasure hunter you are dead, the light of the world is fading\\nReal men don\\'t need other people, and\\nReal men suck it in\\nReal men don\\'t flinch or bleed in public\\nOh, I think I\\'m a real man\\nLittle boys cry and look around for comfort\\nAnd always get what they want\\nLittle boys see toys and say \"I can take that!\"\\nOh, you are my little boy\\nThough honestly, sir\\nAll I wanna do is get naked in front of you\\nSo you can look me up and down and tell me\\n\"Well done, girl, you\\'re looking good\"\\nReal men keep cool in the face of a fire\\nGo down with the ship\\nAnd real men don\\'t eat\\n\\'Cause they\\'re above that, damn it\\nOh, I\\'m gonna be a real man\\nThough honestly, sir\\nAll I wanna do is get naked in front of you\\nSo you can look me up and down\\nAnd give me your love for being so good\\nBut little boys hold me, color me\\nPraise me, make me feel lovely\\nFor a little while\\nSo little boy, say you want me\\n\\'Cause, well, I can\\'t take it\\nGo ahead\\nDo it, do it\\nThere\\'s nobody better than you\\nIt took me a while \\'til I knew\\nBut you knew from the start it was us, didn\\'t you?\\nIt just took me a while \\'til I knew\\nNow I lay as I study a blank wall\\nWould you spare me your voice if I call?\\n\\'Cause you waited and watered my heart \\'til it grew\\nYou just grew a little smarter, too\\nSo, I don\\'t blame you\\nIf you want to bury me in your memory\\nI\\'m not the girl I ought to be, but\\nMaybe when you tell your friends\\nYou can tell them what you saw in me\\nAnd not how I turned out to be\\nThere\\'s some kind of burning inside me\\nIt\\'s kept me from falling apart\\nAnd I\\'m sure that you\\'ve seen what it\\'s done to my heart\\nBut it\\'s kept me from falling apart\\nNow here I lay as I wonder about you\\nWould you just tell me what I\\'m meant to do?\\n\\'Cause I\\'ve waited and watered my heart \\'til it grew\\nYou can see how it\\'s blossomed for you\\nAnd I don\\'t blame you\\nIf you want to bury me in your memory\\nI\\'m not the girl I ought to be, but\\nMaybe when you tell your friends\\nYou can tell them what you saw in me\\nAnd not the way I am\\nAnd I don\\'t mean to make your heart blue\\nBut could we be what we\\'re meant to be?\\nI\\'m just about to beg you, please\\nAnd then, when you tell your friends\\nYou can tell them what you saw in me\\nAnd not the way I used to be\\n\\'Cause there is nobody better than you\\nYour room was square\\nI once noticed from there\\nIn your bed, as you slept\\nAnd I held my breath\\nEverything had its own place\\nAnd I wondered what space would I take\\nIn the order you kept\\nI tried to eat like your girlfriend\\nJust tea in the night, I\\'d end up\\nToo hungry to sleep\\nSo lying awake\\nI would follow the aching inside\\nI would find\\nIt\\'s for you won\\'t be mine\\nI tried my hardest, for I\\'d never learned\\nGod\\'s very simple and love shouldn\\'t burn\\nAnd I would\\'ve offered you all that you yearned for\\nBut I was still waiting for something to earn\\nWhat is that quiet of snow in the night?\\nThe dark rings with white noise as you stand and drown\\nMaybe it\\'s all of these snowflakes\\nScreaming a choir of mute\\nAs they brace for the ground\\nWell, that\\'s my ride\\nHope you had a good night\\nYou know, you made me happy\\nHere, shake my hand\\nYou make such a good man\\nNever once did you know me\\nI tried my hardest, for how do you learn\\nGod\\'s very simple and love doesn\\'t burn\\nAnd maybe you\\'d offered me all that I yearned for\\nBut I was still waiting for something to earn\\nSilly me, waiting\\nI love everybody because I love you\\nWhen you stood up, walked away barefoot\\nAnd the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape\\nI looked over it and I ached\\nI love everybody because I love you\\nI don\\'t need the city, and I don\\'t need proof\\nAll I need, darlin\\', is a life in your shape\\nI picture it, soft, and I ache\\nLook at you, strawberry blond\\nReach out the car window tryin\\' to hold the wind\\nYou tell me you love her, I give you a grin\\nOh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape\\nSo I follow the white lines, follow the white lines\\nKeep my eyes on the road as I ache\\nLook at you, strawberry blond\\nFields rollin\\' on\\nI love it when you call my name\\nCan you hear the bumblebees swarm?\\nWatching your arm\\nI love it when you look my way\\nLook at you, strawberry blond\\nFields rollin\\' on\\nI love it when you call my name\\nCan you hear the bumblebees swarm?\\nWatching your arm\\nI love it when you look my way\\nLook at you, strawberry blond\\nFields rollin\\' on\\nI love it when you call my name\\nCan you hear the bumblebees swarm?\\nWatching your arm\\nI love it when you look my way\\nIsaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah\\nIsaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah\\nI\\'ll live in the bathtub\\nIt\\'s cool and clean\\nIt\\'s smooth and it\\'s steady\\nIt\\'s all that I need\\nI broke our belongings\\nThey\\'re all on the floor\\nThe room is now empty\\nNothing left to throw\\nAll the eggshells are on the ground\\nAnd I try, I\\'m trying to pick them up\\nBut they crack and crumble, it\\'s all too much\\nToo frail for me to touch\\nAll the eggshells are on the ground\\nAnd I try, I\\'m trying to pick them up\\nBut they crack and crumble, it\\'s all too much\\nToo frail for me to touch\\nI\\'ll live in the bathtub\\nSurrounded by tiles\\nAll so square and so steady\\nI will die in their cool, cool arms\\nI broke what you gave me\\nBut you kept giving\\nMore\\nAnd I\\'m sorry for taking\\nBut I keep wanting\\nMore, more, more\\nAll the eggshells are on the ground\\nAnd I try, I\\'m trying to pick them up\\nBut they crack and crumble, it\\'s much too much\\nToo frail for me to touch\\nAll the eggshells are on the ground\\nAnd I try, I\\'m trying to pick them up\\nBut Humpty Dumpty it\\'s much too much\\nToo frail for me to touch\\nHumpty Dumpty\\nIt\\'s much too much\\nI want you\\nI hold one card\\nThat I can\\'t use\\nBut I want you\\nYou\\'re coming back\\nAnd it\\'s the end of the world\\nWe\\'re starting over and I love you darlin\\'\\nAnd I am done, dear\\nYou\\'re in the house\\nAnd I am here in the car\\nI just need a quiet place\\nWhere I can scream how I love you\\nI found you\\nI found the door\\nBut when I stepped through\\nThere was no floor\\nYou\\'re coming back\\nAnd it\\'s the end of the world\\nWe\\'re starting over and I love you darlin\\'\\nAnd I am done, dear\\nYou\\'re in the house\\nAnd I am here in the car\\nI just need a quiet place\\nWhere I can scream how I love you\\nI want you\\nI want you\\nI can still smell the fire\\nEven though it\\'s long died out\\nThe smoke still hangs in my hair\\nAnd on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes\\nSo darling, play your violin\\nI know it\\'s what you live for\\nDarling, play your violin\\nWe will manage somehow\\nI once lived in the sea\\nBring me to your ear, you can hear\\nThe tide where I used to be\\nThough now I\\'m but a shell\\nOh babe\\nDon\\'t say sorry\\nDarling, play your violin\\nI know it\\'s what you live for\\nDarling, play your violin\\nWe will manage somehow\\nDon\\'t dare regret anything\\nRemember what you\\'re here for, you\\nJust play your violin\\nAnd we will manage somehow\\nThere\\'s a lie that I told to you\\nThat now I can\\'t tell the truth\\nAnd it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night\\nI slept with a man you knew\\nAnd in the morning, I walked home alone\\nAnd the businessmen saw my bones\\nWith my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights\\nWhen they were that man you knew\\nYou told me once\\nYou were happy to have me\\nBut I never gave me away\\nThere\\'s a lie that I told to you\\nI would give you my heart, I think\\nBut it\\'s up in a branch of a tree\\nIt was only to tease when he climbed up the tree\\nPut my heart where I couldn\\'t reach\\nI didn\\'t mind, I adored him so\\nWe forgot, and we left for home\\nAnd that was so long ago\\nNow the tree, it has grown\\nAnd nobody knows my lover is buried underground\\nNobody knows my lover is buried underground\\nNobody knows my lover is buried underground\\nThere\\'s a lie that I told to you\\nMom, I\\'m tired\\nCan I sleep in your house tonight?\\nMom, is it alright\\nIf I stay for a year or two?\\nMom, I\\'ll be quiet\\nIt would be just to sleep at night\\nAnd I\\'ll leave once I figure out\\nHow to pay for my own life too\\nMom, would you wash my back?\\nThis once, and then we can forget\\nAnd I\\'ll leave what I\\'m chasing\\nFor the other girls to pursue\\nMom, am I still young?\\nCan I dream for a few months more?\\nIt\\'s beautiful out today\\nI wish you could take me upstate\\nTo the little place you would tell me about\\nWhen you\\'d sense that I want to escape\\nTexas is a landlocked state\\nIt\\'s a little bit far away\\nFrom the water, from the home\\nThat I\\'ve wanted to make\\nIt\\'s somehow in the city\\nYou make it there\\nAnd you make it anywhere, anywhere\\nBut I\\'ve been anywhere\\nAnd it\\'s not what I want\\nAnd I wanna be still with you\\nDo, do-do-do, do\\nYou keep your socks on in bed\\nKeep our hearts warm\\nSee the tree shadows lie in black the pools in the lawns\\nYou\\'re the breeze in my Austin nights\\nYou\\'re the breeze in my Austin nights\\nYou\\'re the breeze in my Austin nights\\nThere\\'s a party and we\\'re all going\\nAnd we\\'re all growing up\\nSomebody\\'s driving and he will be drinking\\nAnd no one\\'s going back\\n\\'Cause we\\'ve tried hungry and we\\'ve tried full and\\nNothing seems enough\\nSo tonight, tonight\\nThe boys are gonna go for\\nMore, more, more\\nAnd I want a love that falls as fast\\nAs a body from the balcony, and\\nI want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground\\nI\\'m holding my breath with a baseball bat\\nThough I don\\'t know what I\\'m waiting for\\nI am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be\\nSmell that, it\\'s wet grass, and smoke in my hair\\nI think I\\'ve had enough\\nBut he wants a finale and I came prepared\\nAnd we\\'re not going back\\nAnd I\\'ve tried sharing and I\\'ve tried caring\\nAnd I\\'ve tried putting out\\nBut the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for\\nMore, more, more\\nAnd change change change is gonna come, but\\nWhen, when, when?\\nAnd I want a love that falls as fast\\nAs a body from the balcony, and\\nI want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground\\nI\\'m holding my breath with a baseball bat\\nThough I don\\'t know what I\\'m waiting for\\nI am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be\\nAnd I want a love that falls as fast\\nAs a body from the balcony, and\\nI want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground\\nI\\'m holding my breath with a baseball bat\\nThough I don\\'t know what I\\'m waiting for\\nI am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be\\nThe black hole\\nOf the\\nWindow\\nWhere you sleep\\nThe night breeze\\nCarries\\nSomething sweet\\nA peach tree\\nWild women don\\'t get the blues\\nBut I find that\\nLately I\\'ve been crying like a\\nTall child\\nSo please hurry leave me\\nI can\\'t breathe\\nPlease don\\'t say you love me\\nOne word from you and I would\\nJump off of this\\nLedge I\\'m on\\nBaby\\nTell me \"don\\'t\"\\nSo I can\\nCrawl back in\\nAnd I was so young\\nWhen I behaved\\nTwenty five\\nYet now I find\\nI\\'ve grown into\\nA tall child\\nAnd I don\\'t wanna go home yet\\nLet me walk to the top of the big night sky\\nPlease hurry leave me\\nI can\\'t breathe\\nPlease don\\'t say you love me\\n胸がはち切れそうで\\nOne word from you and I would\\nJump off of this\\nLedge I\\'m on\\nBaby\\nTell me \"don\\'t\"\\nSo I can\\nCrawl back in\\nOne word from you and I would\\nJump off of this\\nLedge I\\'m on\\nBaby\\nTell me \"don\\'t\"\\nSo I can\\nCrawl back in\\nI don\\'t know what to do without you\\nI don\\'t know where to put my hands\\nI\\'ve been trying to lay my head down\\nBut I\\'m writing this at three AM\\nI don\\'t need the world to see\\nThat I\\'ve been the best I can be, but\\nI don\\'t think I could stand to be\\nWhere you don\\'t see me\\nOn sunny days I go out walking\\nI end up on a tree-lined street\\nI look up at the gaps of sunlight\\nI miss you more than anything\\nI don\\'t need the world to see\\nThat I\\'ve been the best I can be, but\\nI don\\'t think I could stand to be\\nWhere you don\\'t see me\\nAnd autumn comes when you\\'re not yet done\\nWith the summer passing by, but\\nI don\\'t think I could stand to be\\nWhere you don\\'t see me\\nI don\\'t smoke\\nExcept for when I\\'m missing you\\nTo remember your mouth, how it\\nTasted true\\nAnd I don\\'t smoke\\nExcept for after I\\'ve held you, baby\\nBeing with you\\nMakes the flame burn good\\nSo if you need to be mean\\nBe mean to me\\nI can take it and put it inside of me\\nIf your hands need to break\\nMore than trinkets in your room\\nYou can lean on my arm\\nAs you break my heart\\nI\\'m what\\'s left of when we\\nSwam under the moon\\nNow the rest of my days are just\\nWaiting for when\\nYou come down and tell me\\nI was meant for you, baby\\nBeing with you\\nMakes the flame burn good\\nIf you need to be mean\\nBe mean to me\\nI can take it and put it inside of me\\nIf your hands need to break\\nMore than trinkets in your room\\nYou can lean on my arm\\nAs you break my heart\\nJust don\\'t leave me alone\\nWondering where you are\\nI am stronger than you give me\\nCredit for\\nIf your hands need to break\\nMore than trinkets in your room\\nYou can lean on my arm\\nAs you break my heart\\nIt\\'s a windy afternoon\\nCan\\'t afford to buy my food\\nOr the drive I need to go\\nFurther than they said I\\'d go\\nHe only loves me when\\nThere\\'s a means he means to end\\nOh, I miss when we first met\\nHe didn\\'t know me yet\\nSo take me out, baby\\nMakes no difference where we\\'ll be\\nAs long as we\\'re out in the sun\\nTake me out baby\\nTake me out, baby\\nDoesn\\'t matter where we\\'ll be\\nBut please under the light of day\\nI will retire to the Salton Sea\\nAt the age of 23\\nFor I\\'m starting to learn I may never be free\\nBut though I may never be free\\nFuck you and your money\\nI\\'m tired of your money\\nAnd I sit on the curb \\'cause it\\'s the prettiest night\\nWith no one else in sight\\nYou know I wore this dress for you\\nThese killer heels for you\\nSee the dark, it moves\\nWith every breath of the breeze\\nI will take good care of you\\nI will take good care of you\\nEverything you feel is good\\nIf you would only let you\\nI will wash your hair at night\\nAnd dry it off with care\\nI will see your body bare\\nAnd still I will live here\\nSo stay with me\\nHold my hand\\nThere\\'s no need\\nTo be brave\\nAnd all the quiet nights you bear\\nSeal them up with care\\nNo one needs to know they\\'re there\\nFor I will hold them for you\\nCause\\' all I ever wanted is here\\nAll I ever wanted\\nAll I want is\\nAlways you\\nIt\\'s always you\\nAnd we\\'re not out of the tunnel\\nI bet you though there\\'s an end\\nStay with me\\nHold my hand\\nThere\\'s no need\\nTo be brave\\nAnd while you sleep\\nI\\'ll be scared\\nSo by the time you wake\\nI\\'ll be brave\\nI\\'ll be brave\\nI\\'ll be brave\\nAt night\\nOn the roof top\\nI untie my hair\\nAnd watch from my plastic chair\\nAs my dark hair\\nUnleashes the night\\nThe scent of flowers\\nStill in bloom from morning shower\\nAnd I\\nSay your name\\nIn hopes you\\'ll hear it in the stars\\nAnd carry me out\\nCarry me out\\nI drive when it rains\\nAt night when it rains I drive\\nAnd the headlight spirits\\nThey lead me down the styx\\nSo black it shines\\nAnd carry me out\\nCarry me out\\nAt night\\nOn the roof top\\nI untie my hair\\nAnd watch from my plastic chair\\nAs my dark hair\\nUnleashes the night\\nAll of this turbulence wasn\\'t forecasted\\nApologies from the intercom\\nAnd I am relieved that I\\'d left my room tidy\\nThey\\'ll think of me kindly\\nWhen they come for my things\\nThey\\'ll never know how I\\'d stared at the dark in that room\\nWith no thoughts\\nLike a blood-sniffing shark\\nAnd while my dreams made music in the night\\nCarefully\\nI was going to live\\nYou wouldn\\'t leave till we loved in the morning\\nYou\\'d learned from movies how love ought to be\\nAnd you\\'d say you love me and look in my eyes\\nBut I know through mine you were\\nLooking in yours\\nAnd did you know the liberty bell is a replica\\nSilently housed in its original walls\\nAnd while its dreams played music in the night\\nQuietly\\nIt was told to believe\\nI always wanted to die clean and pretty\\nBut I\\'d be too busy on working days\\nSo I am relieved that the turbulence wasn\\'t forecasted\\nI couldn\\'t have changed anyways\\nI am relieved that I\\'d left my room tidy\\nGoodbye\\nHappy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way\\nI poured him tea and he told me it\\'ll all be okay\\nWell I told him I\\'d do anything to have him stay with me\\nSo he laid me down, and I felt Happy come inside of me\\nHe laid me down, and I felt happy\\nOh if you\\'re going, take the train\\nSo I can hear it rumble, one last rumble\\nAnd when you go, take this heart\\nI\\'ll make no more use of it when there\\'s no more you\\nI was in the bathroom, I didn\\'t hear him leave\\nI locked the door behind him and I turned around to see\\nAll the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea\\nWell I sighed and mumbled to myself again, I have to clean\\nI sighed and mumbled to myself\\nIf you\\'re going, take the train\\nSo I can hear it rumble, one last rumble\\nAnd when you go, take this heart\\nI\\'ll make no more use of it when there\\'s no more you\\nAnd if you\\'re going, take the moon\\nThen maybe I will see you, in the night I\\'ll see you\\nAnd when you go, take this heart\\nI\\'ll make no more use of it when there\\'s no more you\\nIn the rearview mirror, I saw the setting sun on your neck\\nAnd felt the taste of you bubble up inside me\\nBut with everybody watching us, our every move\\nWe do have reputations\\nWe keep it secret\\nWon\\'t let them have it\\nSo come inside and be with me, alone with me\\nAlone, with me alone\\nIf you would let me give you pinky promise kisses\\nThen I wouldn\\'t have to scream your name\\nAtop of every roof in the city of my heart\\nIf I could see you\\nOnce more to see you\\nCome inside and be with me, alone with me\\nAlone, with me alone\\nIf you would let me give you pinky promise kisses\\nThen I wouldn\\'t have to scream your name\\nAtop of every roof in the city of my heart\\nIf I could see you\\nOnce more to see you\\nIf I could see you\\nOnce more to see you\\nDo you ever feel like a plastic bag\\nDrifting through the wind, wanting to start again?\\nDo you ever feel, feel so paper thin\\nLike a house of cards, one blow from cavin\\' in?\\nDo you ever feel already buried deep?\\nSix feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing\\nDo you know that there\\'s still a chance for you?\\n\\'Cause there\\'s a spark in you\\nYou just gotta ignite the light\\nAnd let it shine\\nJust own the night\\nLike the Fourth of July\\n\\'Cause baby, you\\'re a firework\\nCome on, show \\'em what you\\'re worth\\nMake \\'em go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\\nAs you shoot across the sky\\nBaby, you\\'re a firework\\nCome on, let your colors burst\\nMake \\'em go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\\nYou\\'re gonna leave \\'em all in awe, awe, awe\\nYou don\\'t have to feel like a waste of space\\nYou\\'re original, cannot be replaced\\nIf you only knew what the future holds\\nAfter a hurricane comes a rainbow\\nMaybe a reason why all the doors are closed\\nSo you could open one that leads you to the perfect road\\nLike a lightning bolt, your heart will glow\\nAnd when it\\'s time, you\\'ll know\\nYou just gotta ignite the light\\nAnd let it shine\\nJust own the night\\nLike the Fourth of July\\n\\'Cause baby, you\\'re a firework\\nCome on, show \\'em what you\\'re worth\\nMake \\'em go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\\nAs you shoot across the sky\\nBaby, you\\'re a firework\\nCome on, let your colors burst\\nMake \\'em go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\\nYou\\'re gonna leave \\'em all in awe, awe, awe\\nBoom, boom, boom\\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon\\nIt\\'s always been inside of you, you, you\\nAnd now it\\'s time to let it through\\n\\'Cause baby, you\\'re a firework\\nCome on, show \\'em what you\\'re worth\\nMake \\'em go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\\nAs you shoot across the sky\\nBaby, you\\'re a firework\\nCome on, let your colors burst\\nMake \\'em go, \"Oh, oh, oh\"\\nYou\\'re gonna leave \\'em all in awe, awe, awe\\nIf I could, I\\'d be your little spoon\\nAnd kiss your fingers forevermore\\nBut, big spoon, you have so much to do\\nAnd I have nothing ahead of me\\nYou\\'re the sun, you\\'ve never seen the night\\nBut you hear its song from the morning birds\\nWell, I\\'m not the moon, I\\'m not even a star\\nBut awake at night I\\'ll be singing to the birds\\nDon\\'t wait for me, I can\\'t come\\nYour mother wouldn\\'t approve of how my mother raised me\\nBut I do, I think I do\\nAnd you\\'re an all-American boy\\nI guess I couldn\\'t help trying to be your best American girl\\nYou\\'re the one\\nYou\\'re all I ever wanted\\nI think I\\'ll regret this\\nYour mother wouldn\\'t approve of how my mother raised me\\nBut I do, I finally do\\nAnd you\\'re an all-American boy\\nI guess I couldn\\'t help trying to be the best American girl\\nYour mother wouldn\\'t approve of how my mother raised me\\nBut I do, I think I do\\nMy baby, my baby\\nYou\\'re my baby, say it to me\\nBaby, my baby\\nTell your baby that I\\'m your baby\\nI bet on losing dogs\\nI know they\\'re losing and I\\'ll pay for my place\\nBy the ring\\nWhere I\\'ll be looking in their eyes when they\\'re down\\nI\\'ll be there on their side\\nI\\'m losing by their side\\nWill you let me, baby, lose\\nOn losing dogs\\nI know they\\'re losing and I\\'ll pay for my place\\nBy the ring\\nWhere I\\'ll be looking in their eyes when they\\'re down\\nI wanna feel it\\nI bet on losing dogs\\nI always want you when I\\'m finally fine\\nHow you\\'d be over me looking in my eyes when I come\\nSomeone to watch me die\\nSomeone to watch me die\\nI bet on losing dogs\\nWhat do you do with a loving feeling\\nIf the loving feeling makes you all alone?\\nWhat do you do with a loving feeling\\nIf they only love you when you\\'re all alone?\\nHolding hands under a table\\nMeeting up in your bedroom\\nMaking love to other people\\nTelling each other it\\'s all good\\nKisses like pink cotton candy\\nTalking to everyone but me\\nI\\'m stayin\\' on later just in case\\nYou come up and ask to leave with me\\nWhat do you do with a loving feeling\\nIf the loving feeling makes you all alone?\\nWhat do you do with a loving feeling\\nIf they only love you when you\\'re all alone?\\nWhat do you do with a loving feeling\\nIf the loving feeling makes you all alone?\\nWhat do you do with a loving feeling\\nIf they only love you when you\\'re all alone?\\nYou only love me when we\\'re all alone\\nDown empty streets sniffing glue, me and you\\nBlank open eyes watch the moon flower bloom\\nIt\\'s been a long, hard 20 year summer vacation\\nBoth these 20 years tryna fill the void\\nCrack baby, you don\\'t know what you want\\nBut you know that you had it once\\nAnd you know that you want it back\\nCrack baby, you don\\'t know what you want\\nBut you know that you\\'re needing it\\nAnd you know that you need it bad\\nWith wild horses running through your hollow bones\\nWild horses running through your hollow bones\\nWent to your room thinking maybe you\\'ll feel something\\nBut all I saw was your burning body waiting\\nAll these 20 years on a vacation\\nCrack baby, you don\\'t know what you want\\nBut you know that you had it once\\nAnd you know that you want it back\\nCrack baby, you don\\'t know what you want\\nBut you know that you\\'re needing it\\nAnd you know that you need it bad\\nCrack baby, you don\\'t know what you want\\nBut you know that you want it\\nYeah, you know that you want it\\nYou know that you-\\nCrack baby, you don\\'t know what you want\\nBut you know that you need it\\nAnd you know that you need it bad\\nToday I will wear my white button-down\\nI\\'m tired of wanting more\\nI think I\\'m finally worn\\nFor you have a way of promising things\\nAnd I\\'ve been a forest fire\\nI am a forest fire\\nAnd I am the fire and I am the forest\\nAnd I am a witness watching it\\nI stand in a valley watching it\\nAnd you are not there at all\\nSo today I will wear my white button-down\\nI can at least be neat\\nWalk out and be seen as clean\\nAnd I\\'ll go to work and I\\'ll go to sleep\\nAnd I\\'ll love the littler things\\nI\\'ll love some littler things\\nMy God, I\\'m so lonely\\nSo I open the window\\nTo hear sounds of people\\nTo hear sounds of people\\nVenus, planet of love\\nWas destroyed by global warming\\nDid its people want too much, too?\\nDid its people want too much?\\nAnd I don\\'t want your pity\\nI just want somebody near me\\nGuess I\\'m a coward\\nI just want to feel alright\\nAnd I know no one will save me\\nI just need someone to kiss\\nGive me one good honest kiss\\nAnd I\\'ll be alright\\nNobody, nobody, nobody\\nNobody, nobody\\nOoh, nobody, nobody, nobody\\nI\\'ve been big and small\\nAnd big and small\\nAnd big and small again\\nAnd still nobody wants me\\nStill nobody wants me\\nAnd I know no one will save me\\nI\\'m just asking for a kiss\\nGive me one good movie kiss\\nAnd I\\'ll be alright\\nI steal a few breaths\\nFrom the world for a minute\\nAnd then I\\'ll be nothing forever\\nAnd all of my memories\\nAnd all of the things I have seen\\nWill be gone\\nWith my eyes with my body with me\\nBut me and my husband\\nWe\\'re doing better\\nIt\\'s always been just him and me\\nTogether\\nSo I bet all I have on that\\nFurrowed brow\\nAnd at least in this lifetime\\nWe\\'re sticking together\\nMe and my husband\\nWe\\'re sticking together\\nAnd I am the idiot with the painted face\\nIn the corner, taking up space\\nBut when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved\\nMe and my husband\\nWe\\'re doing better\\nIt\\'s always been just him and me\\nTogether\\nSo I bet all I have on that\\nFurrowed brow\\nAnd at least in this lifetime\\nWe\\'re sticking together\\nMe and my husband\\nWe\\'re sticking together\\nMe and my husband\\nWe\\'re doing better\\nYou\\'re my number one\\nYou\\'re the one I want\\nAnd you\\'ve turned down\\nEvery hand that has beckoned me to come\\nYou\\'re my number one\\nYou\\'re the one I want\\nAnd I\\'ve turned down every hand\\nThat has beckoned me to come\\n\\'Cause you\\'re the one I got\\nYou\\'re the one I got\\nSo I\\'ll keep turning down the hands\\nThat beckon me to come\\nThough I\\'m a geyser\\nFeel it bubbling from below\\nHear it call, hear it call\\nHear it call to me\\nConstantly\\nAnd hear the harmony\\nOnly when it\\'s harming me\\nIt\\'s not real, it\\'s not real\\nIt\\'s not real enough\\nBut I will be the one you need\\nThe way I can\\'t be without you\\nI will be the one you need\\nI just can\\'t be without you\\nI know that I ended it, but\\nWhy won\\'t you chase after me?\\nYou know me better than I do\\nSo why didn\\'t you stop me?\\nWhy didn\\'t you stop me\\nAnd paint it over?\\nI look for a picture of you\\nTo keep in my pocket\\nBut I can\\'t seem to find one\\nWhere you look how I remember?\\nLook how I remember\\nLook how I remember paint it over\\nWe nearly drowned\\nFor such a silly thing\\nSomeone who loves me now\\nBetter than you\\nAnd that pretty friend is\\nFinally yours, and\\nI\\'ll be around on Sunday, if\\nYou\\'ll meet me at Blue Diner\\nI\\'ll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby\\nAt Blue Diner, I\\'ll take anything you want to give me, baby\\nI haven\\'t told anyone\\nJust like we promised\\nHave you?\\nEvery time I drive through the city where you\\'re from\\nI squeeze a little\\nMeet me at Blue Diner\\nI\\'ll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby\\nAt Blue Diner, I\\'ll take anything you want to give me, baby\\nAt Blue Diner, I\\'ll take coffee, talk about nothing, baby\\nBlue Diner, I\\'ll take anything you want to give me, baby\\nYou\\'re growing tired of me\\nYou love me so hard and I still can\\'t sleep\\nYou\\'re growing tired of me\\nAnd all the things I don\\'t talk about\\nSorry, I don\\'t want your touch\\nIt\\'s not that I don\\'t want you\\nSorry, I can\\'t take your touch\\nIt\\'s just that I fell in love with a war\\nNobody told me it ended\\nAnd it left a pearl in my head\\nAnd I roll it around every night\\nJust to watch it glow\\nEvery night, baby, that\\'s where I go\\nSorry, I don\\'t want your touch\\nIt\\'s not that I don\\'t want you\\nSorry, I can\\'t take your touch\\nThere\\'s a hole that you fill\\nYou fill, you fill\\nBut it\\'s just that I fell in love with a war\\nAnd nobody told me it ended\\nAnd it left a pearl in my head\\nAnd I roll it around every night\\nJust to watch it glow\\nEvery night, baby, that\\'s where I go\\nJust to watch it glow\\nI call you, to see you again\\nSo I can win, and this can finally end\\nSpend an hour on my makeup\\nTo prove something\\nWalk up in my high heels\\nAll high and mighty\\nAnd you say, \"Hello\"\\nAnd I lose\\n\\'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and\\nNobody fucks me like me\\nIn the morning, in a taxi\\nI\\'m so very paying for-\\nWhy am I lonely for lonesome love?\\nWhy am I lonely for lonesome love?\\nWhy am I lonely?\\nI gave too much of my heart tonight\\nCan you come to where I\\'m staying\\nAnd make some extra love?\\nThat I can save \\'til tomorrow\\'s show\\n\\'Cause I need somebody to remember my name\\nAfter all that I can do for them is done\\nI need someone to remember me\\nI need something bigger than the sky\\nHold it in my arms and know it\\'s mine\\nJust how many stars will I need to hang around me\\nTo finally call it Heaven?\\n\\'Cause I need somebody to remember my name\\nAfter all that I can do for them is done\\nI need someone to remember me\\nI need something bigger than the sky\\nHold it in my arms and know it\\'s mine\\nJust how many stars will I need to hang around me\\nTo finally get somewhere I can be all done\\nSomewhere like Heaven\\nCome into the water\\nDo you wanna be my baby?\\nAre you waiting to touch me?\\nYou look so good, but I keep my hands\\n\\'Til you come into the water\\nMaybe I\\'m the same as all those men\\nWriting songs of all they\\'re dreaming\\nBut would you tell me if you want me?\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t move until you show me\\nI didn\\'t know I had a dream\\nI didn\\'t know until I saw you\\nSo would you tell me if you want me?\\n\\'Cause I can\\'t move until you show me\\nI glow pink in the night in my room\\nI\\'ve been blossoming alone over you\\nAnd I hear my heart breaking tonight\\nI hear my heart breaking tonight\\nDo you hear it too?\\nIt\\'s like a summer shower\\nWith every drop of rain singing\\n\"I love you, I love you, I love you\\nI love you, I love you, I love you\\nI love you, I love you, I love you\"\\nI could stare at your back all day\\nI could stare at your back all day\\nAnd I know I\\'ve kissed you before, but\\nI didn\\'t do it right\\nCan I try again, try again, try again\\nTry again, and again, and again\\nAnd again, and again, and again\\nA lake with no fish\\nIs the heart of a horse\\nNamed Cold Air\\nWho, when young\\nWould run like a storm\\nThey would say, ooh\\nI thought I\\'d traveled a long way\\nBut I had circled\\nThe same old sin\\nToss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart\\nBaby, bang it up inside\\nI\\'m not wearing my usual lipstick\\nI thought maybe we would kiss tonight\\nBaby will you kiss me already and\\nToss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart?\\nBaby, bang it up inside\\nBaby, though I\\'ve closed my eyes\\nI know who you pretend I am\\nI know who you pretend I am\\nDoes it smell like a school gymnasium in here?\\nIt\\'s funny how they\\'re all the same\\nIt\\'s funny how you always remember\\nAnd we\\'ve both done it all a hundred times before\\nIt\\'s funny how I still forgot\\nIt would be a hundred times easier\\nIf we were young again\\nBut as it is\\nAnd it is\\nWe\\'re just two slow dancers, last ones out\\nWe\\'re two slow dancers, last ones out\\nAnd the ground has been slowly pulling us back down\\nYou see it on both our skin\\nWe get a few years and then it wants us back\\nIt would be a hundred times easier\\nIf we were young again\\nBut as it is\\nAnd it is\\nTo think that we could stay the same\\nTo think that we could stay the same\\nTo think that we could stay the same\\nBut we\\'re two slow dancers, last ones out\\nWe\\'re two slow dancers, last ones out\\nTwo slow dancers, last ones out\\nLet\\'s step carefully into the dark\\nOnce we\\'re in, I\\'ll remember my way around\\nWho will I be tonight?\\nWho will I become tonight?\\nI\\'ll show you who my sweetheart\\'s never met\\nWet teeth, shining eyes glimmering by a fire\\nLet\\'s drive out to where dust devils are made\\nBy dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand\\nWhere clouds look like mountains, clouds look like mountains\\nLet me watch those mountains from underneath\\nAnd maybe they\\'ll finally float off of me\\nI cry at the start of every movie\\nI guess \\'cause I wish I was making things too\\nBut I\\'m working for the knife\\nI used to think I would tell stories\\nBut nobody cared for the stories I had about\\nNo good guys\\nI always knew the world moves on\\nI just didn\\'t know it would go without me\\nI start the day high and it ends so low\\n\\'Cause I\\'m working for the knife\\nI used to think I\\'d be done by twenty\\nNow at twenty-nine, the road ahead appears the same\\nThough maybe at thirty, I\\'ll see a way to change\\nThat I\\'m living for the knife\\nI always thought the choice was mine\\nAnd I was right, but I just chose wrong\\nI start the day lying and end with the truth\\nThat I\\'m dying for the knife\\nFury, pure and silver\\nYou grip it tight inside\\nLike a knife\\nIt glints in your eye\\nIt\\'s why I\\'ve arrived, your sex god\\nHere to take you where\\nYou need to go\\nTo where the dark remembers you\\nOpen up your heart\\nLike the gates of hell\\nYou stay soft, get beaten\\nOnly natural to harden up\\nYou stay soft, get eaten\\nOnly natural to harden up\\nI am face down on my bed\\nStill not quite awake yet\\nThinking of you\\nI tuck my hand under my weight\\nJust tell me what you want to do\\nTell me what you want\\nTo burn away\\n\\'Cause I could be your stoker\\nOpen up your heart\\nLike the gates of hell\\nYou stay soft, get beaten\\nOnly natural to harden up\\nYou stay soft, get eaten\\nOnly natural to harden up\\nYou stay soft, get beaten\\nOnly natural to harden up\\nYou stay soft, get eaten\\nOnly natural to harden up\\nEveryone, all of them\\nEveryone said, \"Don\\'t go that way\"\\nSo, of course, to that I said\\n\"I think I\\'ll go that way\"\\nAnd I left the door open to the dark\\nI said, \"Come in, come in, whatever you are\"\\nBut it didn\\'t want me yet\\nThen like a babe in a crib\\nAfter some big hand turns out the light\\nAnd I opened my arms wide to the dark\\nI said, \"Take it all, whatever you want\"\\nI didn\\'t know that I was numb\\nI didn\\'t know what it would take\\nI didn\\'t know what it would take\\nSometimes I think I am free\\nUntil I find I\\'m back in line again\\nHeat lightning\\nRunning outside the window\\nI\\'ve laid awake since one\\nAnd now it\\'s four o\\'clock\\nThough I\\'ve held on\\nCan\\'t carry it much longer\\nOn the ceiling dancing\\nAre the things all come and gone\\nAnd there\\'s nothing I can do\\nNot much I can change\\nSo, I give it up to you\\nI hope that\\'s okay\\nThere\\'s nothing I can do\\nNot much I can change\\nI give it up to you, I surrender\\nHeat lightning\\nWatch it from my doorstep\\nSleeping eyelid of the sky\\nFlutters in a dream\\nWell, I\\'ve held on\\nBut feel a storm approaching\\nTrees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones\\nAnd there\\'s nothing I can do\\nNot much I can change\\nCan I give it up to you?\\nWould that be okay?\\nThere\\'s nothing I can do\\nNot much I can change\\nI give it up to you, I surrender\\nThere\\'s nothing I can do\\nNot much I can change\\nI give it up to you, I surrender\\nIf you would just make one mistake\\nWhat a relief that would be\\nBut I think for as long as we\\'re together\\nI\\'ll be the only heartbreaker\\nI\\'ll be the only heartbreaker\\nI\\'ll be the only heartbreaker\\nSo I\\'ll be the loser in this game\\nI\\'ll be the bad guy in the play\\nI\\'ll be the water main that\\'s burst and flooding\\nYou\\'ll be by the window, only watchin\\'\\nI\\'ll be the only heartbreakеr\\nI\\'ll be the only heartbrеaker\\nAnd make me the only heartbreaker\\nSo I\\'ll be the only heartbreaker\\nIf I keep myself at home\\nI won\\'t make the same mistake\\nThat I made for fifteen years\\nI could be a new girl\\nI will be a new girl\\nI wish that this would go away\\nBut when I\\'m done singing this song\\nI will have to find something else\\nTo do to keep me here\\nSomething else to keep me\\nHere\\'s my hand\\nThere\\'s the itch\\nBut I\\'m not supposed to scratch\\nI need you to love me more\\nLove me more, love me more\\nLove enough to fill me up\\nFill me up, fill me full up\\nI need you to love me more\\nLove me more, love me more\\nLove enough to drown it out\\nDrown it out, drown me out\\nHow do other people live?\\nI wonder how they keep it up?\\nWhen today is finally done\\nThere\\'s another day to come\\nThen another day to come\\nThen another day to\\nCome back to mine\\nWe\\'ll pretend it ends tomorrow\\nI need you to love me more\\nLove me more, love me more\\nLove enough to fill me up\\nFill me up, fill me full up\\nI need you to love me more\\nLove me more, love me more\\nLove enough to drown it out\\nDrown it out, drown me out\\nThere\\'s nothin\\' left for you\\nNothin\\' in this room\\nTry and go outside\\nNothin\\' waits for you\\nYou had it once before\\nNot anymore\\nSo go on to that sweetheart\\'s door\\nAnd find a new you\\nGive her all the love you saved for it\\nYou could touch fire\\nYou could fly\\nIt was your right\\nIt was your life\\nAnd then it passed\\nTo someone new\\nIt\\'ll keep passin\\' on\\nLong after you\\nBut you\\'re the only one\\nShe\\'s countin\\' on\\nThere\\'s nothin\\' left for you\\nWell, I went through my list of friends\\nAnd found I had no one to tell\\nOf this overwhelming clean feeling, strange serenity\\nWhen I saw the girl looked just like me\\nAnd it broke my heart\\nThe lengths you went to hold me\\nTo get to have me\\n\\'Cause, I haven\\'t given you what you need\\nYou wanted me but couldn\\'t reach me\\nSo you went into your memory\\nRelive all the ways you still want me\\nI haven\\'t given you what you need\\nYou wanted me but couldn\\'t reach me\\nI\\'m sorry it should\\'ve been me\\nI\\'d be going \\'bout my day until a hand\\nWould come and lift me out\\nAnd drop me in the middle of a labyrinth, where I\\'d be stuck a while\\nWhen I saw the girl looked just like me\\nI thought, \"Must be lonely loving someone\"\\nTryna to find their way out of a maze\\nOh, I know\\nI haven\\'t given you what you need\\nYou wanted me but couldn\\'t reach me\\nSo you went into your memory\\nRelive all the ways you still want me\\nI haven\\'t given you what you need\\nYou wanted me but couldn\\'t reach me\\nI\\'m sorry, it should\\'ve been me\\nI\\'m sorry, it should\\'ve been me\\nWe fought again\\nI ran out the apartment\\nYou say you love me\\nI believe you do\\nBut I walk down and up and down\\nAnd up and down this street\\n\\'Cause you just don\\'t like me\\nNot like you used to\\nThat\\'s our lamp\\nIt shines like a big moon\\nWe may be ending\\nI\\'m standing in the dark\\nLooking up into our room\\nWhere you\\'ll be waiting for me\\nThinking that\\'s where you loved me\\nThat\\'s where you loved me\\nThinking that\\'s where you loved me\\nThat\\'s where you loved me\\nThere\\'s a bug like an angel stuck to the bottom\\nOf my glass, with a little bit left\\nAs I got older, I learned I\\'m a drinker\\nSometimes a drink feels like family\\nFamily\\nHey, what\\'s the matter? Lookin\\' like your sticker\\nIs stuck on a floor somewhere\\nDid you go and make promises you can\\'t keep?\\nWell, when ya break them, they break you right back\\nAmateur mistake\\nYou can take it from me\\nThey break you right back\\nBreak you right back\\nOoh, ooh\\nOoh, ooh-ooh\\nWhen I\\'m bent over, wishin\\' it was over\\nMakin\\' all variety of vows I\\'ll never keep\\nI try to remember the wrath of the devil\\nWas also given him by God\\nMosquitoes can enjoy me, I can\\'t go inside\\nI\\'m suckin\\' up as much of the full moon, so bright\\nFireflies zoomin\\' through the yard like highway cars\\nSomeone out here burnin\\' something, kids feelin\\' alive\\nFreight train stampedin\\' through my backyard\\nIt\\'ll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced\\nI have a hope and though she\\'s blind with no name\\nShe shits where she\\'s supposed to, feeds herself while I\\'m away\\nSometimes I think it would be easier without her\\nBut I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleepin\\' face\\nFreight train horn howlin\\' out mad and wild\\nHeadin\\' somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced\\nI don\\'t like my mind, I don\\'t like being left alone in a room\\nWith all its opinions about the things that I\\'ve done\\nSo, yeah, I blast music loud and I work myself to the bone\\nAnd on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake\\nA whole cake, all for me\\nAnd then I get sick and throw up and there\\'s another memory that gets stuck\\nInside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk\\nAnd it may be a few years, but you can bet it\\'s there, waiting still\\nFor me to be left alone in a room with the things that I\\'ve done\\nA whole cake, so please don\\'t take\\nTake this job from me\\nA whole cake, so please don\\'t take\\nTake my job from me\\nThere\\'s a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone\\nLook around, listen close, hear it fall from above\\nIt will ask what you\\'d give and what you\\'d take for it in return\\nI once went on such a walk and I found that I\\'d said\\nI want someone to take this soul\\nI can\\'t bear to keep it, I\\'d give it just to give\\nAnd all I will take are the consequences\\nWill somebody take this soul?\\nThen, of course, nothing replied\\nNothing speaks to you in the night\\nAnd I walked my way home, there was no one in sight\\nSave a bird perched upon a streetlight, watching me\\nSo, I stopped and let it watch till I found that it said\\nNow I\\'m taken, the night has me\\nYou won\\'t hear me singing, you\\'re a cage without me\\nYour pain is eased, but you\\'ll never be free\\nFor now, I\\'m taken, the night has me\\nThere\\'s a deal that I made\\nWhen memories snow\\nAnd cover up the driveway\\nI shovel all those memories\\nClear the path to drive to the store\\nAnd when memories melt\\nI hear them in the drainpipe\\nDripping through the downspout\\nAs I lie awake in the dark\\nAnd if I break\\nCould I go on break?\\nBe back in my room\\nWriting speeches in my head\\nListening to the thousand hands that clap for me in the dark\\nMoon, a hole of light\\nThrough the big top tent up high\\nHere before and after me\\nShining down on me\\nMoon, tell me if I could\\nSend up my heart to you\\nSo, when I die, which I must do\\nCould it shine down here with you?\\n\\'Cause my love is mine, all mine\\nI love, my, my, mine\\nNothing in the world belongs to me\\nBut my love, mine, all mine, all mine\\nMy baby here on Earth\\nShowed me what my heart was worth\\nSo, when it comes to be my turn\\nCould you shine it down here for her?\\n\\'Cause my love is mine, all mine\\nI love, my, my, mine\\nNothing in the world belongs to me\\nBut my love, mine, all mine\\nNothing in the world is mine for free\\nBut my love, mine, all mine, all mine\\nRemember when we met?\\nWe acted like two fools\\nWe were so glad\\nSo glad to have found it\\nThat love is like a star\\nIt\\'s gone, we just see it shining\\nIt\\'s traveled very far, I\\'ll\\nKeep a leftover light\\nBurning, so you can keep looking up\\nIsn\\'t that worth holding on?\\nYou know I\\'d always been alone\\nTill you taught me\\nTo live for somebody\\nThat love is like a star\\nIt\\'s gone, we just see it shining\\n\\'Cause it\\'s traveled very far, I\\'ll\\nKeep a leftover light\\nBurning, so you can keep looking up\\nI\\'m yours no matter\\nThat love\\'s gone\\nWe just see it shining\\nWe\\'ve traveled very far, I\\'ll\\nKeep a leftover light\\nBurning, so you can keep looking up\\nIsn\\'t that worth holding on?\\nYou\\'re an angel, I\\'m a dog\\nOr you\\'re a dog and I\\'m your man\\nYou believe me like a God\\nI destroy you like I am\\nI\\'m sorry I\\'m the one you love\\nNo one will ever love me like you again\\nSo, when you leave me, I should die\\nI deserve it, don\\'t I?\\nI can feel it getting near\\nLike flashlights coming down the way\\nOne day you\\'ll figure me out\\nI\\'ll meet judgment by the hounds\\nPeople always gave me love\\nOthers were never to blame after all\\nYou believe me like a God\\nI betray you like a man\\nBrushing my hair naked\\nSpritz my face with toner\\nSplash water on my neck\\nLaughing in the mirror\\nCool water in a glass\\nDrink it down, how\\nI love me after you\\nKing of all the land\\nStride through the house naked\\nDon\\'t even care that the\\nCurtains are open\\nLet the darkness see me\\nStreets are mine, the night is mine\\nAll my own, how\\nI love me after you\\nKing of all the land\\nI\\'m king of all the land'"
